## It does not work

Because I can get neither the container nor the host to successfully `kinit` against FEDORAPROJECT.ORG.
In the container I get:

```
Invalid UID in persistent keyring name while getting default ccache
```

On the host I get:

```
Cannot contact any KDC for realm 'FEDORAPROJECT.ORG' while getting initial credentials
```
